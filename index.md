# About Me

My name is Xiaoyong Pan, and a tenure-track associate professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong Unversity. I was a PostDoc at Ghent University and BASF, Belgium from Feb, 2019 to July, 2019. Before that, I was a postdoc in Department of Medical informatics at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
I obtained a Ph.D. from Copenhagen University in 2017, jointly supervised by Prof. <a href="https://rth.dk/~gorodkin/">Jan Gorodkin</a> and Prof. <a href="https://jensenlab.org">Lars Juhl Jensen</a>, and a M.E. from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2011, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn">Hong-Bin Shen</a>. From 2011 to 2013, I worked as a 
software engineer in IBM Corporation for two and half years before starting my Ph.D in Copenhagen University. I was supported by a Ph.D. fellowship from Copenhagen University from 2013 to 2016.
In 2013, I received outstanding master thesis award from Shanghai Education Commission. I have published over 20 papers at prominent journals, and serve as an associate editor for BMC Bioinformatics.
